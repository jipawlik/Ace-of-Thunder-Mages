# What is this project? ðŸ‘¾

Ace of Thunder Mages is a small RPG game written entirely in JavaScript and my own portfolio project that I contribute to in my free time. 
I understand that there are some questions. Let's face it, we both apparently have nothing better to do at the moment than exchanging some absolutely crucial information.

## What, why, seriously, why? ðŸ‘¾
Thunder Mages are...fantastic creatures that have mixed into the society and pretending to be regular people, but they are truly gifted in many skills that they successfully develop by simple tools like mouses, keyboards, monitors, computers...of course you know already who they are - the members of the most majestic Github Guild of Magic. Some call them software developers, but it's kind of a lame nerdy name (oh, wait...).

Ok, from now I'll hold my horses and stick to the reality.

## More seriously, why? ðŸ‘¾

For now it will be my portfolio project to present my resume and skills in a more interesting and creative way.
Video game is the most powerful self expression medium that combines multiple art types in one - visual arts, 
music, literature, film. It's absolutely amazing and since I've gained a fantastic skill which is coding I'm now able to express myself in that way.

I've chosen Vanilla JavaScript for this project over any library. The reason for that is that for now the project is small enough for me to squeeze out the knowledge about how everything is working under the hood. As a Bootcamp survivor (ha!) I was not able to get to know the language any better and since I've very quickly started to work professionally as a Frontend Developer I've missed the opportunity to really learn, what JS can do. 

If the project grows, I plan to switch to another game making tool, but for now, I'd like to keep the simplicity.

## Anything more to the project? ðŸ‘¾

The art and sprites in the game are created entirely by myself.

State of the project:
18 Jan 2023
It's Wednesday my dears.

there is a room and the character is walking limited by walls.
Next state: adding dialogues to interact with objects.
