- 
- add talking text queues
- a counter -> how many times an object was approached
add state management for that (with recognition which object exactly was approached)



!! - refactoring of externalWalls in utils. 
function is adding walls from gameObjects, but they are not working
walls from externalWalls are working though
this means that probably objects are mounted later? 
but changing the queue isn't working
