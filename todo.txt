NOW:
- a counter -> how many times an object was approached
add state management for that (with recognition which object exactly was approached)
- add non essential talking to objects (nested)
- change font

- add close funtion on esc button, or an ex at the top of the text bar
- the height should not be fixed -> as much as it needs
- divide sofa sprite and table sprite - they will have different interactions


!! - refactoring of externalWalls in utils. 
function is adding walls from gameObjects, but they are not working
walls from externalWalls are working though
this means that probably objects are mounted later? 
but changing the queue isn't working




****working queue****
- hero is able to interact with every item
- you can download cv on the computer
- add multiple talking queues
- collect items by interacting with items
- add another room
- add a hidden room (hidden with password)
- before uploading -> make an instrucion to increase size of the game on screen (ctr + scroll works)
- skills section -> make a dance (multiple sprites animation)
- add white sprite to the text bar
- add desciption about game creator, sprites, art, music etc.
