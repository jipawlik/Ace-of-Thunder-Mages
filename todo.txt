NOW
- remove assignWall function from utils. walls need to run from the map directly.
find out why it's not working
- leave the title screen for now until you figure out what fails
- walls are there, but the hero won't stop while approaching them
- test if the match function works. 


****working queue****
FIRST POLISH UP THE MAIN ROOM, THEN ADD ELEVATOR, THEN SECRET LAB
- collect items by interacting with items
- add another room
- add a hidden room (hidden with password)
- before uploading -> make an instrucion to increase size of the game on screen (ctr + scroll works)
- skills section -> make a dance (multiple sprites animation)
- add white sprite to the text bar
- add desciption about game creator, sprites, art, music etc.


- get points by interacting with essential items
if you get the maximum you are immediately killed by a monster in the basement
he's a hacker that was waiting to know everything to destroy the system
as a revenge

- if not interacted with everything the monster fights
concentrate on web version, no mobile, no mouse-only (it,s not possible to play with mouse anyway)

TECH DEBT

There is a tech debt in the game, because of no engine or library is used.
Some of code might be improved, but I'd go too far with it unless it really breaks.

!! - refactoring of externalWalls in utils. 
function is adding walls from gameObjects, but they are not working
walls from externalWalls are working though
this means that probably objects are mounted later? 
but changing the queue isn't working
!! - refactoring of if-else horror in the textmessage compoenent
