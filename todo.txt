NOW:
check out event bubbling again
check out web dev simplified text adventure game tut, since the code now is inefficient

- a counter -> how many times an object was approached
add state management for that (with recognition which object exactly was approached)
- add non essential talking to objects (nested)
- you can download cv drawer
- add another event type for that

- text message box has 2 buttons for nested textMessage! 
create a text box with more configuration


- 1.GO FORWARD WITH TUTORIAL



!! - refactoring of externalWalls in utils. 
function is adding walls from gameObjects, but they are not working
walls from externalWalls are working though
this means that probably objects are mounted later? 
but changing the queue isn't working




****working queue****
FIRST POLISH UP THE MAIN ROOM, THEN ADD ELEVATOR, THEN SECRET LAB
- hero is able to interact with every item
- add multiple talking queues
- collect items by interacting with items
- add another room
- add a hidden room (hidden with password)
- before uploading -> make an instrucion to increase size of the game on screen (ctr + scroll works)
- skills section -> make a dance (multiple sprites animation)
- add white sprite to the text bar
- add desciption about game creator, sprites, art, music etc.


- get points by interacting with essential items
if you get the maximum you are immediately killed by a monster in the basement
he's a hacker that was waiting to know everything to destroy the system
as a revenge

- if not interacted with everything the monster fights
