check out what is better: to add an id into every wall coord
or to modify the game object class and add coords in there -> then run the 
assignWalls function and iterate it thorugh every game object that exists.
also add id into every game object

to achieve: if person walks, the nextCoords match any wallCoord (same as assignwalls function)
console.log into which object the person has run into and clicked enter.
the function needs to be reusable
